<h1 id="secretstroll">SecretStroll</h1>
<p>This README is available in two formats: README.md and README.html .</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this project, you will develop a location-based application, SecretStroll, that enables users to search for nearby points of interest (POI). We provide you with a skeleton to help with the development.</p>
<p><strong>Virtualization.</strong> We use Docker to enforce isolation between the client and server on the virtual machine. Docker is a piece of software that uses the capabilities of the Linux kernel to run processes in a sandboxed environment. Thus, both the server and the client will “think” they are running in two independent systems.</p>
<p>We also provide a virtual machine (VM) to facilitate the setup and configuration of the SecretStroll and reduce potential networking problems while running the application in different environments.</p>
<p><strong>Skeleton.</strong> Both the client and the server provide a command-line interface to run and interact with the server. The underlying location-based service is already implemented in the skeleton, and your task is to add the authentication with attribute-based credentials.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend to use the <code>petrelic</code> cryptographic-pairing library to implement PS credentials. You can find the project repository in <a href="petrelic">https://github.com/spring-epfl/petrelic/</a> and you can visit <a href="docs">https://petrelic.readthedocs.io</a> for documentation. This library is bundled in the provided Docker container and virtual machines.</p>
<p>The skeleton has already implemented and integrated capabilities to save, manage, and load keys and credentials as byte arrays. You need to implement (de)serialization methods to match the API. We provide <code>serialization.py</code> as a <code>petrelic</code> extension of <code>jsonpickle</code>, a serialization library, to help you with the serialization of cryptographic objects.</p>
<p>Our skeleton and docker infrastructure takes care of syncing and deploying your code. You only need to implement attribute-based credentials and update the <code>your_code.py</code> file to use it.</p>
<p><strong>Testing</strong>. An integral part of system development is testing the system. In your implementation, you should check both success and failure paths when your working with cryptographic primitives. In this project, you <strong>must</strong> use the <em>pytest</em> framework to test your system. You can visit <a href="pytest_turorials">https://www.tutorialspoint.com/pytest/index.htm</a> for guides.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-the-development-environment">Setting up the development environment</h2>
<p>We use Python 3 in this project and all necessary Python components are already installed on the VM and dockers. You can find installed libraries in the <code>requirements.txt</code> file.</p>
<p>Feel free to have a look at <code>client.py</code> and <code>server.py</code> to see how the classes and methods are used.</p>
<h3 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h3>
<p>You can use git repositories to sync your work with your teammates. However, keep in mind that you are not allowed to use public repositories, so make sure that your repository is <strong>private</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="virtual-machine">Virtual machine</h3>
<p>We provide you with a VM for SecretStroll project. We have already installed the skeleton, and all the necessary applications and libraries on the VM. <strong>We only provide support for projects running inside the VM and we strongly recommend you to develop inside the VM.</strong></p>
<p>There are two accounts on the VM (<code>user:password</code>):</p>
<pre><code>student:student
root:root</code></pre>
<p>You can set up ssh on the VM and connect from your host or directly use the VM as your development environment.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-ssh-in-virtualbox">Setting up ssh in VirtualBox</h3>
<p>In VirtualBox, you can set up ssh access to the VM by following these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the settings of your image</li>
<li>Go to the “Network” panel</li>
<li>Choose “Advanced” and click on the “Port forwarding” button</li>
<li>Add a forwarding rule (green “plus” button on the side)</li>
<li>In the forwarding rule, leave IP addresses empty, set <strong>Host port</strong> to <em>2222</em>, and <strong>Guest port</strong> to 22 (the default SSH port)</li>
<li>Restart the virtual machine</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, you can connect to your virtual machine via ssh: <code>ssh -p 2222 student@127.0.0.1</code></p>
<p>This is how you copy files <em>TO</em> the VM: <code>scp -P 2222 &lt;path_to_copy_from_on_host_OS&gt; student@127.0.0.1:&lt;path_to_copy_to_on_guest_OS&gt;</code></p>
<p>Copy files <em>FROM</em> the VM: <code>scp -P 2222 student@127.0.0.1:&lt;path_to_copy_from_on_guest_OS&gt; &lt;path_to_copy_to_on_host_OS&gt;</code></p>
<h2 id="files-in-the-skeleton">Files in the skeleton</h2>
<p>The skeleton contains the following files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>your_code.py</code>—Source code that you have to complete.</li>
<li><code>client.py</code>—client CLI calling classes and methods defined in <code>your_code.py</code>.</li>
<li><code>server.py</code>—server CLI calling classes and methods defined in <code>your_code.py</code>.</li>
<li><code>serialization.py</code>—Extends the library <code>jsonpickle</code> to serialize python objects.</li>
<li><code>requirements.txt</code>—Required Python libraries.</li>
<li><code>docker/</code>—directory containing Docker configurations for running the client and the server.</li>
<li><code>docker-compose.yaml</code>—<em>docker compose</em> configuration describing how to run the Docker containers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="server-and-client-deployment">Server and client deployment</h2>
<p>The server and client code deployment is handled by Docker and our skeleton. In this section, we introduce our Docker infrastructure and how to use it. Then, we provide a step-by-step guide of running the client and server.</p>
<h3 id="working-with-the-docker-infrastructure">Working with the Docker infrastructure</h3>
<p><em>Before launching the infrastructure, ensure the <code>tor</code> directory in the project skeleton has the correct permissions</em></p>
<pre><code>student@cs523:~/skeleton$ chmod 777 tor
student@cs523:~/skeleton$ ls -ld tor
drwxrwxrwx 2 student student    4096 mar 24 15:31 tor</code></pre>
<p>The server and the client run in a Docker infrastructure composed of 2 containers, and a virtual network.</p>
<p>Before setting up the Docker infrastructure for the first time, you must first build the images which will be used to run the client and server containers. To do so, run the following command in the skeleton directory, which contains the file <code>docker-compose.yml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>docker-compose build</code></pre>
<p>Note: We have already built the dockers inside the VM.</p>
<p>To set up the Docker infrastructure, run the following command in the directory containing the file <code>docker-compose.yml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>docker-compose up -d</code></pre>
<p>When you stop working with the infrastructure, remember to shut it down by running the following command in the directory containing the file <code>docker-compose.yml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>docker-compose down</code></pre>
<p><em>If you forget to shut down the Docker infrastructure, e.g., before shutting down your computer, you might end up with stopped Docker containers preventing the creation of the new ones when you to re-launch the infrastructure the next time. This can be fixed by removing the network bridge with <code>docker-compose down</code> and destroying the stopped Docker containers with <code>docker container prune -f</code>.</em></p>
<h3 id="accessing-the-data">Accessing the data</h3>
<p>The code of the skeleton is shared between your VM and Docker containers, so modifications you make in your VM will also appear in containers. Feel free to read the file <code>docker-compose.yml</code> to see how it is done.</p>
<p>If you need to transfer some data between your VM and your host machine, you can set up ssh access and use the <code>scp</code> command as detailed before. Another option is to have shared directories between the VM and your host. For this feature to work correctly you have to install <em>Guest Additions</em> from VirtualBox on the VM and refer to their documentation.</p>
<h3 id="server">Server</h3>
<p>It is easier to run the commands in a Docker container by opening a shell, then running the commands inside this shell.</p>
<p>To execute a shell in the container in which the server is to be launched, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>docker exec -it cs523-server /bin/bash</code></pre>
<p>In this container, the root directory of the project is mounted on <code>/server</code>.</p>
<pre><code>cd /server</code></pre>
<p>The server has two subcommands: <code>gen-ca</code> and <code>run</code>. <code>gen-ca</code> generates the public and secret keys, and <code>run</code> runs the server. The server and its subcommands have a help option, which you can access using the <code>-h</code> argument.</p>
<p>Key generation example:</p>
<pre><code>python3 server.py gen-ca -a &#39;attributes&#39; -s key.sec -p key.pub

usage: server.py gen-ca [-h] -a ATTRIBUTES -p PUB -s SEC

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a ATTRIBUTES, --attributes ATTRIBUTES
                        Valid attributes recognised by the server.
  -p PUB, --pub PUB     Name of the file in which to write the public key.
  -s SEC, --sec SEC     Name of the file in which to write the secret key.</code></pre>
<p>Server run example:</p>
<pre><code>python3 server.py run -s key.sec -p key.pub

usage: server.py run [-h] -p PUB -s SEC

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -p PUB, --pub PUB  Name of the file containing the public key.
  -s SEC, --sec SEC  Name of the file containing the secret key.
</code></pre>
<p>In the Part 3 of the project, the server is expected to be accessible as a Tor hidden service. The server’s Docker container configures Tor to create a hidden service and redirects the traffic to the Python server. The server serves local and hidden service requests simultaneously by default.</p>
<p>The server also contains a database, <code>fingerprint.db</code>. This is used in Part 3. The database has a POI table that contains records for each POI. The server returns the list of POIs associated with a queried cell ID, and information about each POI in the list. You must not modify the database.</p>
<h3 id="client">Client</h3>
<p>To execute a shell in the client container, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>docker exec -it cs523-client /bin/bash</code></pre>
<p>In this container, the root directory of the project is mounted on <code>/client</code>.</p>
<pre><code>cd /client</code></pre>
<p>The client has four subcommands: <code>get-pk</code>, <code>register</code>, <code>loc</code>, and <code>grid</code>. As for the server, the client and its subcommands have a help option, which you can access using the <code>-h</code> argument.</p>
<p>Use <code>get-pk</code> to retrieve the public key from the server:</p>
<pre><code>python3 client.py get-pk -o key-client.pub

usage: client.py get-pk [-h] [-o OUT] [-t]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -o OUT, --out OUT  Name of the file in which to write the public key.
  -t, --tor          Use Tor to connect to the server.
</code></pre>
<p>Use <code>register</code> to register an account on the serve:</p>
<pre><code>python3 client.py register -a &#39;attributes&#39; -p key-client.pub -u your_name -o attr.cred

usage: client.py register [-h] [-p PUB] [-o OUT] -a ATTRIBUTES [-t] -u USER

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PUB, --pub PUB     Name of the file from which to read the public key.
  -o OUT, --out OUT     Name of the file in which to write the attribute-based
                        credential.
  -a ATTRIBUTES, --attributes ATTRIBUTES
                        String representing the attributes.
  -t, --tor             Use Tor to connect to the server.
  -u USER, --user USER  User name.
</code></pre>
<p>Use <code>loc</code> and <code>grid</code> commands to retrieve information about points of interests using lat/lon location (Part 1) and cell identifier (Part 3), respectively:</p>
<pre><code>python3 client.py loc -p key-client.pub -c attr.cred -r &#39;revealed_attrs&#39; 46.52345 6.57890

usage: client.py loc [-h] -p PUB -c CRED -r REVEAL [-t] lat lon

positional arguments:
  lat                   Latitude.
  lon                   Longitude.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PUB, --pub PUB     Name of the file from which to read the public key.
  -c CRED, --cred CRED  Name of the file from which to read the attribute-based
                        credential.
  -r REVEAL, --reveal REVEAL
                        Attributes to reveal. (format: attr1,attr2,attr3).
  -t, --tor             Use Tor to connect to the server.</code></pre>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: The database only contains points of interest with latitude in range [46.5, 46.57] and longitude in range [6.55, 6.65] (Lausanne area). You can make queries outside these values, but you will not find anything interesting.</p>
<pre><code>python3 client.py grid -p key-client.pub -c attr.cred -r &#39;revealed_attrs&#39; 42

usage: client.py grid [-h] -p PUB -c CRED -r REVEAL [-t] cell_id

positional arguments:
  cell_id               Cell identifier.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PUB, --pub PUB     Name of the file from which to read the public key.
  -c CRED, --cred CRED  Name of the file from which to read the attribute-based credential
                        credential.
  -r REVEAL, --reveal REVEAL
                        Attributes to reveal.
  -t, --tor             Use Tor to connect to the server.</code></pre>
<h2 id="a-sample-run-of-part-1">A sample run of Part 1</h2>
<p>Here we show a typical run of the system for Part 1.</p>
<p>Initialization:</p>
<pre><code>Open a shell
$ cd skeleton
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up -d</code></pre>
<p>Server side:</p>
<pre><code>Open a shell
$ cd skeleton
$ docker exec -it cs523-server /bin/bash
(server) $ cd /server
(server) $ python3 server.py gen-ca -a &#39;attributes&#39; -s key.sec -p key.pub
(server) $ python3 server.py run -s key.sec -p key.pub</code></pre>
<p>Client side:</p>
<pre><code>Open a shell
$ cd skeleton
$ docker exec -it cs523-client /bin/bash
(client) $ cd /client
(client) $ python3 client.py get-pk -o key-client.pub
(client) $ python3 client.py register -a &#39;attributes&#39; -p key-client.pub -u your_name -o attr.cred
(client) $ python3 client.py loc -p key-client.pub -c attr.cred -r &#39;revealed attrs&#39; 46.52345 6.57890
</code></pre>
<h2 id="a-sample-run-of-part-3">A sample run of Part 3</h2>
<p>Here we provide a typical run of the system for Part 3:</p>
<p>Initialization:</p>
<pre><code>Open a shell
$ cd skeleton
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up -d</code></pre>
<p>Server side:</p>
<p>You should have already generated the keys in Part 1, so you do not need to repeat that step.</p>
<pre><code>Open a shell
$ cd skeleton
$ docker exec -it cs523-server /bin/bash
(server) $ cd /server
(server) $ python3 server.py run -s key.sec -p key.pub</code></pre>
<p>Client side:</p>
<p>You should have already performed the registration in Part 1, so you do not need to the repeat the step. Use the grid parameter to query for a particular cell. Set the reveal argument (-r) to an empty value. Set the -t argument to use Tor. The example run below queries the server for cell ID = 42.</p>
<pre><code>Open a shell
$ cd skeleton
$ docker exec -it cs523-client /bin/bash
(client) $ cd /client
(client) $ python3 client.py grid -p key-client.pub -c attr.cred -r &#39;[]&#39; -t 42</code></pre>
