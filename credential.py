# The goal of this skeleton is helping you start with the credential.
# Following this API is not mandatory and you can change it as you see fit.
# This skeleton only provides major classes/functionality that you need. You 
# should define more classes and functions.

# Hint: for a clean code, you should create classes for messages that you want
# to pass between user and issuer. The serialization helps you with (de)serializing them
# (network API expects byte[] as input).
